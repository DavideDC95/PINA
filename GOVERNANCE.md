# Governance Policy

This document provides the governance policy for the PINA. Maintainers agree to this policy and to abide by all PINA polices, including the [code of conduct](https://github.com/mathLab/PINA/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), [trademark policy](https://github.com/mathLab/PINA/blob/master/TRADEMARKS.md), and [antitrust policy](https://github.com/mathLab/PINA/blob/master/ANTITRUST.md) by adding their name to the [maintainers.md file](https://github.com/mathLab/PINA/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md).

## 1. Roles.

This project may include the following roles. Additional roles may be adopted and documented by the Project.

**1.1. PINA Organization**. The PINA Organization provides strategic and policy stewardship, manages project assets (including Marks as defined in the trademark policy), resolves escalations, and approves changes to governance and charter documents.

**1.2. Maintainers**. Maintainers are responsible for organizing activities around developing, maintaining, and updating the project. Maintainers are also responsible for determining consensus. Maintainers may be added or removed with the approval of the current Maintainers.

**1.3. Contributors**. Contributors are those who make contributions to the project (e.g., code, documentation, issues, reviews).

## 2. Decisions.

**2.1. Consensus-Based Decision Making**. The project seeks consensus of the Maintainers. While explicit agreement of all Maintainers is preferred, it is not required. Maintainers will determine consensus based on good-faith consideration of factors including the dominant view of Contributors and the nature of support and objections. Evidence of consensus should be documented (e.g., via issues/PRs, meeting notes).

**2.2. Appeal Process**. Project decisions may be appealed by opening an issue. Maintainers will consider the appeal in good faith and respond in writing within a reasonable time. If the Maintainers deny the appeal, it may be escalated to the PINA Organization, which will also respond in writing within a reasonable time.

## 3. How We Work.

**3.1. Openness**. Participation is open to anyone who is directly and materially affected by the activity in question. There shall be no undue financial barriers to participation.

**3.2. Balance**. The development process should balance the interests of Contributors and other stakeholders. Contributors from diverse interest categories shall be sought with the objective of achieving balance.

**3.3. Coordination and Harmonization**. Good faith efforts shall be made to resolve potential conflicts or incompatibility between releases in this Project.

**3.4. Consideration of Views and Objections**. Prompt consideration shall be given to the written views and objections of all Contributors.

**3.5. Written procedures**. This governance document and other materials documenting this project's development process shall be available to any interested person.

## 4. No Confidentiality.

Information disclosed in connection with any Project activity, including but not limited to meetings, contributions, and submissions, is not confidential, regardless of any markings or statements to the contrary.

## 5. Trademarks.

Any names, trademarks, logos, or goodwill developed by and associated with the project (the “Marks”) are controlled by the PINA Organization. Maintainers and Contributors may only use these Marks in accordance with the project’s (trademark policy)[].

## 6. Amendments.

Amendments to this governance policy may be made by affirmative vote of 2/3 of all Maintainers, with approval by the Organization's Steering Committee.
